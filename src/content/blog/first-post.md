# First test blog post!

Welcome to the digital wasteland of scattered thoughts and incomplete ideas. This is a test post. Nothing more. Or maybe everything more. Who knows?

Hereâ€™s a list of nonsense:

-   Frogs in space
-   Reversed entropy tacos ðŸŒ®
-   JavaScript that screams
-   A CSS class named `.what-is-life`

```js
function existentialVoid() {
	console.log('You are in a loop. There is no escape.')
	return '404 meaning not found'
}
```
